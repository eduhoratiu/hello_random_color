## Hello World

"Hello World" programs hold a special place in the learning curve of any new programming language or platform. They represent the most basic form of a complete program, offering a simple way for beginners to get started with coding. These programs typically display a basic message, like "Hello, World!", to demonstrate the syntax and basic functionality of the language.

"Hello Random Color" builds upon this foundational concept by not only displaying a simple message but also by introducing interactivity and basic state management in Flutter. While retaining the simplicity of a "Hello World" program, it adds an element of dynamic content â€“ the random color display. This approach makes the app a good stepping stone for beginners in Flutter, as it bridges the gap between basic syntax understanding and practical application in a real-world scenario.
